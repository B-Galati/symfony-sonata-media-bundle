Step 0: Requirements
====================

This bundle needs `Symfony Framework`_ 3.3+, `Sonata Admin`_ 3.2.28+, `Flysystem`_ 2.0+ and `Glide`_ 1.2+ to work correctly.

The docs assume you have previously configured a `Flysystem`_ filesystem which is needed to follow the steps.
It is highly recommended to use the `Flysystem Bundle`_ to make configuration of your file systems a lot easier.
